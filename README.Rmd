The goal of ausPH is to retrieve data from the [Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia](https://handbook.aph.gov.au/) and return ready-to-analyse data, formatted as a `tibble`. The package relies on the data from the Handbook site, which is still in beta and subject to change and improvement.

At present, the package contains the following functions:

-   `get2CP` (Data on two candidate preferred results since 1919)[^1]
-   `getCommitteeMembers` (Data on committee memberships since 1902)
-   `getElections` (Data on elections since 1901)[^2]
-   `getElectorates` (Data on electorates since 1901)
-   `getIndividuals` (Data on individuals and biographical information since 1901)
-   `getParliaments` (Data on Parliamentary terms since 1901)

[^1]: The get2CP function does not retrieve live data from the API, since retrieval in real time is currently infeasible. In addition, some missing elections were identified in the current PH data. Therefore the function returns PH data *with* supplementary data points, documented in the Note variable.

[^2]: missing elections were filled in, with accompanying new unique identifiers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ausPH from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("palesl/ausPH")
```

## Examples

These examples show some simple functionality of the package:

```{r example}
library(ausPH) 
## get elections

getElections(chamber = "all", byelections = T)

## get a list of parliaments

getParliaments()

## get two candidate preferred since 1919

get2CP()
```
