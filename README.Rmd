The goal of ausPH is to retrieve data from the [Parliamentary Library's Handbook website](https://handbook.aph.gov.au/). The first example is two candidate preferred results by year and by district.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ausPH from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("palesl/ausPH")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem [TBC]:

```{r example}
library(ausPH)
## basic example code
```
