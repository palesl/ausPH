The goal of ausPH is to retrieve data from the [Parliamentary Handbook
of the Commonwealth of Australia](https://handbook.aph.gov.au/) and
return ready-to-analyse data, formatted as a `tibble`. The package
relies on the data from the Handbook site, which is still in beta and
subject to change and improvement.

At present, the package contains the following functions:

-   `get2CP` (Data on two candidate preferred results since 1919)[^1]
-   `getCommitteeMembers` (Data on committee memberships since 1902)
-   `getElections` (Data on elections since 1901)[^2]
-   `getElectorates` (Data on electorates since 1901)
-   `getIndividuals` (Data on individuals and biographical information
    since 1901)
-   `getParlService` (data on parliamentary tenures of MPs and senators
    since 1901)
-   `getParliaments` (Data on Parliamentary terms since 1901)
-   `getMinisters` (Data on Ministers since 1901)
-   `getShadowMinisters` (Data on Shadow Ministers since 1901)
-   `getParties` (Data on Parties since 1901)
-   `getPartyService` (Data on Party Service of MPs and Senators since
    1901) 
-   `getMinistries` (Data on Ministries and Governing Parties since
    1901) 
-   `getOccupations` (Data on all pre-parliamentary occupations listed
    since 1901)
-   `getSittingDates` (Data on all parliamentary sitting dates since
    1901)

[^1]: The get2CP function does not retrieve live data from the API,
    since retrieval in real time is currently infeasible. In addition,
    some missing elections were identified in the current PH data.
    Therefore the function returns PH data *with* supplementary data
    points, documented in the Note variable.

[^2]: missing elections were filled in, with accompanying new unique
    identifiers.
